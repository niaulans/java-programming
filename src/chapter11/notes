- abstraction => something that exist but doesn't have concrete existence.
              => template

abstraction key points:
- abstract classes and methods are templates that are meant to be implemented by their subclasses
- classes and methods are declared abstract by using the abstract keyword
- if a subclass extends from an abstract class, it must implement its abstract methods, or be declared abstract itself
- abstract classes cannot be instantiated, it is only to be used as a superclass. if even one method in a class is abstract, the class must be declared abstract as well.

interface key points:
- interfaces cannot be instantiated
- interfaces are implemented (not extended)
- any class that implements an interface, must implement all of its methods or it must declare itself abstract
- methods in an interface must be abstract (no explicit declaration needed) or default
