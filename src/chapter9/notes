- Superclass constructors run before the subclass's constructor
- Use 'super' to call specific constructors
- super calls must be first
- some constructor must be executed

- overriding => subclass change the method that inherits from superclass
- overloading => same method name but different parameters

limiting access in inheritance
- constructors are not inherited
- public and protected members ara inherited by its subclass
- private members are not inherited
- final methods are inherited but cannot be overridden.
