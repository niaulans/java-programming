- polymorphism => a subclass can define their own unique behaviors and yet share
some of the same behaviors of their superclass

polymorphism key points
- An object can have a superclass type, and a subclass instance.
- Polymorphism object can only access the methods of their type (not their instance).
  Casting is required in order to access the methods of their instance.
- If a method is overriden by the subclass, the polymorphic object will execute the overriden
  method at runtime
- The instance operator is used to determine if an object is an instance of a certain class.
